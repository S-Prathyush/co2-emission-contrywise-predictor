Overview
This project aims to predict CO2 emissions country-wise for a specific year using machine learning models and integrate it into a web application using Flask as a backend. The website provides users with the capability to select a country and a year, and it returns the predicted CO2 emission for that country in the chosen year.

Features
CO2 Emission Prediction: Utilizes machine learning model trained on historical data to predict CO2 emissions for various countries.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive web interface for users to input country and year information.
Real-Time Prediction: Performs real-time prediction of CO2 emissions based on user inputs.

Usage
Open the website in your web browser.
Enter the CountryID of the Country you want to predict (Verify the Country name and its respective CountryID from the below data).
Choose a year for which you want to predict CO2 emissions.
Click on the "Predict" button.
The predicted CO2 emission for the selected country and year will be displayed on the screen.
